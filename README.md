The above project follows the crisis of the Covid-19 crisis which was an outbreak of the Covid-19 virus all over the world. With data collected from countries all over the world, i was ableto build a data analysis notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trend. The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries and vaccinations across countries and time. The project cleans and process real-world data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools
The Objectives of the project were:
  1.Import and clean COVID-19 global data
  2.Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
  3.Compare metrics across countries/regions
  4.Visualize trends with charts and maps
  5.Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

List of tools and libraries used in the project
 1.Pandas for data analysis
 2.Matplotlib for Data visualization
 3.Seaborn for exploring and understanding data
 4.Plotly express for providing charts for generating charts
